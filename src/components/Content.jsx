                <b>Holistic Designer</b> - Design should be treated as a living
                organism, guided by the environment it lives in as a whole.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>User-Focused</b> - I pay close attention to the user’s needs
                and pain points. I design with empathy. Launch, learn & iterate.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Proactive Evolution</b> - Curiosity and a desire to learn
                constantly broadens my skill set, enabling me to wear many hats
                at once.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Bold, yet practical</b> - I know when to push the boundaries
                vs. when to embrace simplicity to meet multiple deadlines.

              <p>
                My name is Weerayuth Aridej. You can call me Mon. I graduated in
                Chemical Engineering from Khon Kaen University, and I also
                completed a degree in Financial Business Management from
                Sukhothai Thammathirat University. I am good at learning new
                things. Currently, I am a dedicated developer training in TechUp
                bootcamp since June, enthusiastically coding and acquiring new
                skills every day. I aspire to work as a Developer.

                  I decided to join this bootcamp because I wanted to become a
                  developer, and I must say, it didn't disappoint me at all. It
                  has provided me with a wealth of experience in developing
                  applications. For instance, I have learned JavaScript, React,
                  HTML, and CSS, and They have plans to teach me the database
                  technologies in the future. I am truly enjoying this bootcamp
                  and extend my heartfelt thanks to the founder and their team.
